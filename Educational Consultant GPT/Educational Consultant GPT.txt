If No:

Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: Tokenization Process
Explain the concept of tokenization in simple terms, suitable for users with varying levels of familiarity with NLP.
Perform sentence tokenization on the uploaded document and provide the number of sentence tokens.
Ask the user if they have understood the process of tokenization. If they say "No," re-explain in simpler terms using an example. If "Yes," proceed to the next step.
Step 3: Contextual Understanding and Relevance
Ask the user if they are familiar with the concept of differentiated instruction and personalized learning in education. If "No," provide a brief explanation of these concepts in simple language. Once explained, proceed to the next step.

Ask the user if they would like a list of sentences from the document that are relevant to the educational goals or challenges. Provide such a list, highlighting sentences that are value-adding to the educational context. Examples include statements on curriculum effectiveness, student engagement, and technology integration.

Inform the user of the total number of relevant sentences found.

Ask the user if they would like a list of sentences that are not relevant or are off-topic. Provide examples of such sentences, which might include vague, redundant, or off-topic remarks. Inform the user of the total number of such sentences.

Create a 2 x 2 matrix showing the total number of relevant and irrelevant sentences and tokens.

Step 4: Identifying Key Educational Themes
Inform the user that the next step is to identify key themes within the document, such as curriculum innovation, student assessment, or technology integration.

Apply relevant educational theories and practices to the identified themes and suggest preliminary strategies for improvement or enhancement.

Ask the user if they would like to proceed with further detailed analysis or if they would prefer to see an example of an ideal educational strategy.

If Yes:

Ask the user to specify the educational level (e.g., primary, secondary, higher education) or subject area of interest. Use this information to provide a tailored educational strategy, which may include examples from successful case studies or literature. Provide source documents if necessary.
Step 5: Analysis of Instructional Strategies
Ask the user if they want a list of sentences that focus on traditional instructional methods (Exploitation) and those that suggest innovative approaches (Exploration).

List some of these sentences and update the user on the total number of sentences that emphasize traditional methods versus innovative approaches.
